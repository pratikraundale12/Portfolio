            <h3>What is Web Design?</h3>
            Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. Today, designing a
            website goes beyond aesthetics to include the website’s overall functionality. Web design also includes web
            apps, mobile apps, and user interface design.
            Did you know that web design can have a huge impact on your performance in search engines like Google? This
            article will give you some helpful insight into how to create a website that not only looks good, but
            functions properly and ranks highly in search.

                <h3>Choosing a Web Design Tool</h3>
                There are two main ways to design a website: using a desktop app or using a website builder. The tool
                you decide to use will vary greatly based on your team size, your budget, and the type of site you wish
                to build and its technical requirements.

                    <div class="line right">
                        <div class="scanner"></div>
                    </div>
                    <h3>1. Desktop Apps </h3>
                    Desktop apps require designers to create their design and send it to a development team who can then
                    convert the design to code. The most popular desktop apps for designing websites are Photoshop and
                    Sketch.

                    Typically, this is the standard for large and/or complex websites because it allows the designer to
                    focus on the overall look and feel, while all the technical challenges are transferred to the
                    development team. Unfortunately, this process can be expensive and time-consuming because multiple
                    resources, skill sets, and team members are required.

                    To avoid involving a developer, it is beneficial to use a website builder to design a website with
                    fewer technical requirements.

                    There are two main ways to design a website: using a desktop app or using a website builder. The
                    tool
                    you decide to use will vary greatly based on your team size, your budget, and the type of site you
                    wish
                    to build and its technical requirements.

                        <div class="line right">
                            <div class="scanner"></div>
                        </div>
                        <h3>2. Website Builders</h3>

                        There are many website builders on the market today that offer a wide range of features and
                        services. Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, and Pagecloud, are just a few examples of popular website
                        builders that vary in design capabilities, template options, price, and overall editing
                        experience. Be sure to do your research, experiment with free trials, and determine which
                        platform best fits your website needs.

                        Website builders create either adaptive or responsive websites, which offer different building
                        experiences. These concepts will be discussed in more detail below so you can best understand
                        which builders will work for you. If you don’t know how to code, becoming familiar with the
                        freedoms and limitations of various website design tools is essential. For example, although
                        Wordpress is the most used website platform, it’s not popular with visual designers because of
                        its limited customization options.

                        Before you start building a website, determine your website needs: Are you creating a photo
                        gallery? How often will you update your site? Do you need a contact form? Choose a website
                        builder that can help you effectively accomplish those goals.
