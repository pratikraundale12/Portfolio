                Front-End Developer
                A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications.The difference between
                Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while
                back-end refers to how it works.You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.
                The basic languages for Front-End Development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                    <h3>Backend web devlopment </h3>
                    Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. It focuses on databases, scripting,
                    website architecture. It contains behind-the-scene activities that occur when performing any action
                    on a website. It can be an account login or making a purchase from an online store. Code written by
                    back-end developers helps browsers to communicate with database information.

                    There are two main ways to design a website: using a desktop app or using a website builder. The
                    tool
                    you decide to use will vary greatly based on your team size, your budget, and the type of site you
                    wish
                    to build and its technical requirements.
