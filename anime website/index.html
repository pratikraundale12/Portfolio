    <p>Domain Expansion is the most supreme technique of any jujutsu user. It is achieved by expanding one's innate domain with cursed energy while using a barrier to construct it inside a separate space. The caster then imbues their cursed technique within the barrier to complete the expansion, allowing them to deploy their ability all throughout the domain.
<br>
        A specific hand sign or signal unique to the user is required to expand someone's respective domain.From the outside, a domain's barrier is normally completely closed, making it appear as a floating black sphere that can even be moved slightly if needed </p>

            Jujutsu High assigns their sorcerer's grades to assess their skill level ascending from Grade 4 to Grade 1. Students generally start at Grade 4 upon joining the school, but this depends on experience.[1]

Cursed spirits are ranked on a similar scale but not exact. The higher-ups can be particular when it comes to ranking cursed spirits. The distinct difference between a grade 2 and a semi-grade 1 curse is whether or not it is capable of using cursed techniques. <br>
<br>
Jujutsu sorcerers are expected to take on missions involving curses of the same level. A Grade 2 sorcerer should be able to defeat a Grade 2 curse because their skill level is closer to the strength of a Grade 1 curse.

        <ul class="order">
        <li> Grade 4 - "A wooden bat is enough."</li>

                <p>A cursed technique is activated through the act of pouring cursed energy into it, utilizing one of two processes; Lapse or Reversal. If cursed energy is comparable to electricity, cursed techniques are the appliances that use that power to function. Cursed energy is processed through a procedure akin to a mathematic formula within the user to activate a cursed technique.
                        <br>
                    <br>1. Lapse <br>
                    Lapse (順転 Junten?, lit. "Forward Rotation") refers to the basic, default, or neutral state of activation for a cursed technique. To activate a cursed technique through lapse, the caster circulates their cursed energy in a forward direction to channel it into their ability.
                    <br>
                    Note: The Cursed Technique Lapse of the Limitless is a reinforced version of its Lapse that's activated when the technique is used to strengthen cursed energy.
                    Reversal
                    Reversal (反転 Hanten?, lit. "Reverse Rotation") produces positive energy by multiplying negative energy with negative energy. Negative energy isn't suitable for recovering but positive energy can heal physical injuries. However, it requires highly sophisticated manipulation of cursed energy to achieve, so the ability to do so is rare.
                    <br>
                    <br>*2. Subtraction <br>
                    "To excel at jujutsu is to excel at subtraction."
                    
                    Cursed techniques often require hand signs (掌しゅぅ印いん Shōin?), empowered words (呪じゅ詞し Jushi?), or other gestures to activate. A sorcerer's skill is determined by the degree to which they can minimize and omit these components to make their abilities more efficient. Conversely, the purposeful inclusion of incantations or rituals can elevate a cursed technique's effectiveness.</p>

                    <p>The Six Eyes were always bound to Master Tengen and the Star Plasma Vessel by fate. At some point in the past, Kenjaku was defeated by two different users of the Six Eyes. After his second defeat, Kenjaku did not take any chances and killed another Six Eyes user a month after they were born. Despite Kenjaku doing the same to the Star Plasma Vessel, the Six Eyes reappeared alongside a new Star Plasma Vessel on the day of the merger. <br>
                           <br>
                        This connection was severed by Toji Fushiguro, a man who escaped cursed energy through Heavenly Restriction and destroyed all of their destinies. This inevitably led to the current user of the Six Eyes getting sealed by Kenjaku. </p>
