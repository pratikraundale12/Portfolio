        <p>Technique Debut: Episode 8 (Boring)</p>
        <p>Inumaki is easily one of the most fascinating characters in Jujutsu Kaisen. The fact that he can only use a limited vocabulary to convey his points highlights the fact that his Cursed Technique is incredibly powerful perhaps more than he can control himself. <br>
         <br>
            His Cursed Speech allows Inumaki to control the actions of his enemies by shouting orders that are powered by his Cursed Energy. Such a powerful technique takes a huge toll on his body, with Inumaki being rendered unable to speak if he ends up overusing this technique.</p>

        <p>Technique Debut: Chapter 205 (Stars and Oil)</p>
        <p>Kenjaku is a heinous curse user who has remained alive for many years with an ability that lets him transplant his brain into others, rendering him immortal until the brain itself is taken out. Not only does this curse user take on the abilities of its possessed body, but Kenjaku can also use Domain Expansion to completely decimate his enemies if he wishes. <br>
           <br>
            Womb Profusion, his Domain Expansion, is a disgusting technique to witness firsthand. He forms a pillar made entirely out of cursed spirits that can hit enemies for massive damage, essentially killing any unprepared foe who has no idea just how powerful this Domain Expansion technique really is. The fact that the true power of this technique hasn't been properly seen yet is a shame.</p>

        <p>Technique Debut: Episode 1 (Ryomen Sukuna)</p>
        <p>Megumi is poised to become one of the most unique and engaging characters in Jujutsu Kaisen. His Ten Shadows power might be fairly weak right now, but its sheer potential is limitless. It's going to take Megumi quite some time to master this technique, but there's no denying that watching him use the Ten Shadows technique at its maximum potential is going to be an absolute blast. <br>
          <br>
            If Megumi manages to hone his ability to a T, there's no telling what this man will be capable of. However, he has been on the back foot in most of his battles, which does take away a bit from the power of his technique.

                        <p>Technique Debut: Episode 168 (Tokyo No. 1 Colony, Part 8)s</p>
                        <p>It takes something really special for a relatively new jujutsu sorcerer to showcase an ability so powerful that Gojo himself acknowledges just how dangerous this power really is. Fumihiko is a character introduced during the Culling Game who has the power to turn his jokes into reality, which means that the sky's the limit for this powerful Cursed Technique. <br>
                           <br>
                            The only respite that most of his opponents have is that Fumihiko himself is unaware of just how powerful this ability is. There are times when he can lose faith in his own jokes, which is understandable given his status as a failed comedian. Still, it's oddly unnerving to see a character who has so much power that they themselves don't know how to control it, making it easy to see why fighting this sorcerer can be pretty challenging indeed.

                                <p>It goes to say that Sukuna has some of the most powerful abilities in the history of the series. There's a reason why even the toughest Jujutsu Sorcerers fear his presence since this Malevolent Being can level entire buildings and tear apart any enemy that may be unlucky enough to stand in his way. <br>
                                   <br>
                                    One of his abilities that essentially magnifies his Cleave technique to his surroundings is Spiderweb, leaving a huge trail of destruction in its wake. Any person unlucky to be caught in this attack will be sliced into ribbons in no time at all, which can make for a rather unceremonious demise indeed.</p>

                                    <p>Combining both the Red and Blue powers of Gojo's Limitless technique makes for a brilliant spectacle of explosive power. Gojo wastes no time in bringing out this move during the Goodwill Event when Hanami starts wreaking havoc. <br>
                                        <br>
                                        This technique is so powerful that Hanami would've been completely obliterated had it not been for his swift thinking. The true potential of this technique is yet to be seen, and fans can't wait for Gojo to whip out this technique once again in a later season of Jujutsu Kaisen.</p>
